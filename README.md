Jemi Choi:  
Responsible for: Donation and Donor Entities  
Branch location:  https://github.com/sasha-s-07/Hospital-Project/tree/donation    
Learnings:  
I am responsible for the donors and donation entities. Unfortunately, at this point in time, I have not gotten the Views to work fully yet.  I  will continue to work through the bugs that keep popping up. For every project I have done so far, new types of bugs seem to appear. They are endless in variety. And this time around, I am keeping a log of the different bugs with solution so that I can reference them if I encounter them again.
