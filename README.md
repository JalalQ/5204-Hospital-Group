# Hospital-Project

I have worked on the Volunteer

Learnings: My major learning has been to WebAPI and MVC controllers for this project. In the last submission I had used the MVC controller (auto-scaffolding approach). Due to this, there had been a large learning curve for me for this project.
Although this gave me so many errors yet i have worked with WebAPI and MVC controllers this time and i am able to do CRUD with the help of your videos and example.
