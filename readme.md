1. Since some fiels and models were added to project, I could learn about migration and some its errors and its commands. For example 

downgrade database.

2. List view had error.At first step , I crated model view, beacause data came from diffrent models.Secondly,I checked the controller It

 worked, but view had error.Finally, I used debug step by step. I found the problem and fixed it.

 3.Also, I fixed Details and Delet. In the projec blank view and bootstrap to style were used. 

 4. In Details, data can't display correctly, I debug it step by step, data are transferd to view and are corrct in view but not in list.

 5. In the project, 3 roles are defined:Admin,Registereduser, Staff.
 
 6.3 fields were added to ApplicationUser table:name, lastname, healthNumber.

 7. Id from ApplicationUser were added to model appointment as a Foreign key, because we need registered user Information to book an 
 
 appointment.

 8. A Customised register form was created. 3 fields added to register form.

 9. For the purpose, at the first, fields were added Account View Model.

 10.And then, those were added Views->register 

 11.Since, ApplicationUser is associated appointment, we can keep information users who booked and appointment.
